    <h3 class="text-xl font-raleway font-semibold text-primarytextcolor mb-3 mt-6">Introduction: Blockchain’s Growing Role in Industry</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">In today’s fast-moving digital economy, businesses across industries are exploring blockchain technology to streamline operations, increase transparency, and enhance cybersecurity.
